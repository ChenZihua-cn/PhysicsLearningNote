# Chapter 0

In this chapter, we will learn what we study on mechanics and the history of the mechanics first.
I think our purpose of developing the theory is to understand the motion of the object initially. For this reason, Isaac Newton set up the ***Geomechanics***, Joseph-Louis Lagrange developed the  ***Analytical Mechanics*** and William Rowan Hamilton set up the ***Hamiltonian mechanics*** which be changed in new math language.
